There\\'s some blatantly obscene graffiti splattered across your front door, offensive images and rude words splashed on the walls and windows. Your television has been tipped over.

The sight of so many books never failed to excite me, rows and rows of books with multicolored spines. I\\'d spent an inordinate amount of time choosing my stack of books that day, with the sky growing more ominous. At first, I wasn\\'t worried as I had long legs and was a pretty fast walker, but then it became apparent that there was no way I was going to beat the impending storm. It grew colder, the winds picked up, followed by heavy rains, then pelting hail. I slid the books under my coat to protect them, I had a long way to go; I stepped in puddles and could feel the icy water permeate my ankle socks.

A whole range of clues, of words, of languages escape us. I mean we\\'re not perfect, we\\'re not gods. But on top of that people mis-speak, sometimes you mis-hear, sometimes you don\\'t have attention, sometimes people use words you don\\'t know. Sometimes people use languages you don\\'t know. On a daily basis, human beings are very comfortable with a large component of communication, which is incomprehensibility, incomprehension. We tend to be comfortable with it. But for an immigrant, it becomes very different. What most of us consider normative comprehension an immigrant fears that they\\'re not getting it because of their lack of mastery in the language.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;And what\\'s a normal component in communication, incomprehension, in some ways for an immigrant becomes a source of deep anxiety because you\\'re not sure if it\\'s just incomprehension or your own failures. My sense of writing a book where there is an enormous amount of language that perhaps everyone doesn\\'t have access to was less to communicate the experience of the immigrant than to communicate the experience that for an immigrant causes much discomfort but that is normative for people. which is that we tend to not understand, not grasp a large part of the language around us. What\\'s funny is, will Ramona accept incomprehension in our everyday lives and will greet that in a book with enormous fury. In other words what we\\'re comfortable with out in the outside world, we do not want to encounter in our books.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;So I\\'m constantly, people have come to me and asked me\u2026 is this, are you trying to lock out your non-Dominican reader, you know? And I\\'m like, no? I assume any gaps in a story and words people don\\'t understand, whether it\\'s the nerdish stuff, whether it\\'s the Elvish, whether it\\'s the character going on about Dungeons and Dragons, whether it\\'s the Dominican Spanish, whether it\\'s the sort of high level graduate language, I assume if people don\\'t get it that this is not an attempt for the writer to be aggressive. This is an attempt for the writer to encourage the reader to build community, to go out and ask somebody else. For me, words that you can\\'t understand in a book aren\\'t there to torture or remind people that they don\\'t know. I always felt they were to remind people that part of the experience of reading has always been collective. You learn to read with someone else. Yeah you may currently practice it in a solitary fashion, but reading is a collective enterprise. And what the unintelligible in a book does is to remind you how our whole, lives we\\'ve always needed someone else to help us with reading.&amp;rdquo;","author":"Junot D\u00edaz","image_url":"https:\/\/images.gr-assets.com\/authors\/1487667538p2\/55215.jpg","tags":["books","language","reading"],"page":"31","country_iso":"THA","country":"Thailand","city":"Aranyaprathet","latitude":"13.6824","longitude":"102.4969","location":"13.6824,102.4969","quoted_at":"2010-12-18 10:07:37"},{"quote":"&amp;ldquo;Knowing I lov\\'d my books, he furnish\\'d me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.&amp;rdquo;","author":"William Shakespeare","image_url":"https:\/\/images.gr-assets.com\/authors\/1424313573p2\/947.jpg","tags":["books","libraries","reading"],"page":"31","country_iso":"COD","country":"Congo (Kinshasa)","city":"Matadi","latitude":"-5.8166","longitude":"13.4500","location":"-5.8166,13.4500","quoted_at":"2010-11-14 10:07:37"},{"quote":"&amp;ldquo;Oh for a book and a shady nook,&lt;br \/&gt;Either indoors or out,&lt;br \/&gt;with the green leaves whispering overhead,&lt;br \/&gt;or the street cries all about.&lt;br \/&gt;Where I may read at all my ease&lt;br \/&gt;both of the new and old,&lt;br \/&gt;For a jolly good book whereon to look&lt;br \/&gt;is better to me than gold&amp;rdquo;","author":"John          Wilson","image_url":"https:\/\/images.gr-assets.com\/authors\/1512820606p2\/15830754.jpg","tags":["books","reading"],"page":"31","country_iso":"BRA","country":"Brazil","city":"Macapa","latitude":"0.0330","longitude":"-51.0500","location":"0.0330,-51.0500","quoted_at":"2013-04-22 10:07:37"},{"quote":"&amp;ldquo;As I walked in the dark through the tunnels and tunnels of books, I could not help being overcome by a sense of sadness.

Inside a book, any Physiks or Magical Laws or Manners or Histories may hold sway. A book is its own universe and while in it, you must play by their rules. More or less. Some of the more modern novels are lenient on this point and have very few policemen to spare. This is why sometimes, when you finish a book, you feel strange and woozy, as though you have just woken up. Your body is getting used to the rules and your own universe again. And your own universe is just the biggest and longest and most complicated book ever written-except for all the other ones. This is also why books along the walls make a place feel different-all those universes, crammed into one spot! Things are bound to shift and warp and hatch schemes!&lt;br \/&gt;Two: Books Are People. Some are easy to get along with and some are shy, some are full of things to say and some are quiet, some are fanciful and some are plainspoken, some you will feel as though you\\'ve known forever the moment you open the cover, and some will take years to grow into. Just like people, you must be introduced properly and sit down together with a cup of something so that you can sniff at each other like tomcats but lately acquainted. Listen to their troubles and share their joys. They will have their tempers and you will have yours, and sometimes you will not understand a book, nor will it understand you-you can\\'t love all books any more than you can love every stranger you meet. But you can love a lot of them. And the love of a book is a precious, subtle, strange thing, well worth earning, And just like people, you are never really done with a book-some part of it will stay with you, gently changing the way you see and speak and know.&lt;br \/&gt;Three: People Are Books. This has two meanings. The first is: Every person is a story. They have a beginning and a middle and an end (though some may have sequels and series).They have motifs and narrative tricks and plot twists and daring escapes and love lost and love won. The rules of books are the rules of life because a book must be written by a person alive, and an alive person will usually try to tell the truth about the world, even if they dress it up in spangles and feathers. &lt;br \/&gt;The other meaning is: When you read a book, it is not only a story. It is never only a story. Exciting plots may occur, characters suffer and triumph, yes, It is a story. But it is also a person speaking to you, directly to you. A person far away, perhaps in time, perhaps in space, perhaps both. A person who wanted to say something so loud that everyone could hear it. A book is a time-travelling teleportation machine. And there\\'s millions and millions of them! When you read a book, you have a conversation with the person who wrote it. And that conversation is never quite the same twice. Every single reader has a different chat, because they are different people with different histories and ideas in their heads. Why, you cannot even have the same conversation with the same book twice! If you read a book as a child, and again as a Grown-Up, it will be something altogether other. New things will have happened to you, new folk will have come into your life and taught you wild and wonderful notions you never thought of before. You will not be the same person-and neither will the book. When you read, know that someone somewhere wrote those very words just for you, in hopes that you would find something there to take with you in your own travels through time and space.&amp;rdquo;","author":"Catherynne M.

And why don\\'t women quickly succumb to them, without the need for all this skill and ingenuity in conquering them? For there is no need to go to war for a castle that is already captured.

And if anyone tells me that books are full of women like these, it is this very reply, frequently given, which causes me to complain. My response is that women did not write these books nor include the material which attacks them and their morals. Those who plead their cause in the absence of an opponent can invent to their heart\\'s content, can pontificate without taking into account the opposite point of view and keep the best arguments for themselves, for aggressors are always quick to attack those who have no means of defence. But if women had written these books, I know full well the subject would have been handled differently. They know that they stand wrongfully accused, and that the cake has not been divided up equally, for the strongest take the lion\\'s share, and the one who does the sharing out keeps the biggest portion for himself.&amp;rdquo;","author":"Christine de Pizan","image_url":"https:\/\/images.gr-assets.com\/authors\/1226260516p2\/51133.jpg","tags":["books","clich%C3%A9s","deceit","defenselessness","double-standards"],"page":"29","country_iso":"PER","country":"Peru","city":"Abancay","latitude":"-13.6396","longitude":"-72.8900","location":"-13.6396,-72.8900","quoted_at":"2011-11-28 10:07:37"},{"quote":"&amp;ldquo;He wasn\\'t an alchemist, or a hero.
